time_format: 24h
```

## Usage

### Compact Display

The card shows a minimal dashboard view with:
- **Entity Name**: Your TRV device name
- **Next Transition**: The next scheduled temperature change (time and target temperature)
- **Current Temperature**: The current temperature reading (if available)

**Click anywhere on the card to open the full schedule editor.**

### Editing the Schedule

1. **Open Editor**: Click on the compact card to open the schedule editor dialog
2. **Expand a Schedule Group**: Click on Weekdays, Saturday, or Sunday header to expand/collapse
3. **Modify Times**: Click on the time input to set when the temperature should change
4. **Set Temperatures**: Adjust the temperature for each of the 4 periods
5. **Apply**: Click "Apply Schedule" to send the schedule to your TRV
6. **Close**: Click the × button or click outside the dialog to close

### Schedule Format

MOES TRVs support **three schedule groups**, each with **exactly 4 time periods**:

- **Weekdays** (Monday-Friday): 4 periods
- **Saturday**: 4 periods  
- **Sunday**: 4 periods

**Note**: The 4-period limit per group is a MOES TRV hardware limitation. You cannot add or remove periods, only modify the times and temperatures.

### Default Schedule

**Weekdays** (Mon-Fri):
- **06:00** - 18°C (Morning warmup)
- **10:00** - 15°C (Economy during day)
- **17:00** - 18°C (Evening warmup)
- **22:00** - 15°C (Night setback)

**Saturday & Sunday**:
- All periods set to 15°C (customize as needed)

### Schedule String Format

The card generates schedules in MOES TRV format:
```
"06:00/18°C  10:00/15°C  17:00/18°C  22:00/15°C  06:00/15°C  10:00/15°C  17:00/15°C  22:00/15°C  06:00/15°C  10:00/15°C  17:00/15°C  22:00/15°C"
```

Note the double-space separators between each period (4 weekday + 4 Saturday + 4 Sunday = 12 periods total).

### Tips

- **Energy Saving**: Lower temperatures during work hours and overnight
- **Weekend Comfort**: Set Saturday/Sunday for lazy mornings or all-day comfort
- **Consistent Scheduling**: Keep similar times across all groups for routine
- **Reset**: Use "Reset to Default" to start over if needed

## Compatibility

This card is designed to work with MOES TRVs integrated into Home Assistant through:

- **Zigbee (MQTT/Text Entity)** - For Zigbee-based MOES TRVs exposed as text entities (recommended)
- **Tuya Integration** - For Tuya/WiFi MOES devices
- **Zigbee2MQTT** - For Zigbee-based MOES TRVs
- **ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation)** - Native Zigbee integration

### Entity Types Supported

- `text.*` entities - Common for Zigbee devices with schedule attributes
- `climate.*` entities - Traditional climate/thermostat entities

### MOES TRV Models

Tested and compatible with:

- MOES BRT-100-TRV
- MOES HY368 / HY369
- MOES ZigBee TRV
- Similar Tuya-based TRVs

## Troubleshooting

### Card Not Appearing

1. Verify the files are in `config/www`
2. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Ensure the resource is added to `configuration.yaml`

### Schedule Not Applying

1. **For text entities**: Verify the entity accepts the `text.set_value` service
2. **For climate entities**: Check that your TRV integration supports schedule setting
3. Check Home Assistant logs for error messages
4. Ensure your TRV is online and responding
5. Verify the schedule string format matches what your device expects

### Entity Not Found

1. Verify the entity ID is correct (check for `text.*_schedule` or `climate.*` entities)
2. For Zigbee devices, ensure the schedule entity is exposed to Home Assistant
3. Check that your TRV is properly integrated in Home Assistant
4. Try using Developer Tools > States to confirm the entity exists and its type

## Development

This card is built using:

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
